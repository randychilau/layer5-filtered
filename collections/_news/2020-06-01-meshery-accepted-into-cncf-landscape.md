<div class="center" style="color:#00b39f;position:relative;top:-10px;font-size:1.00em;">A story about growing together as a community and building a project that matters</div>

Meshery took its first baby steps into the Cloud native world in the February of 2019, aiming to provision and manage the lifecycle of service meshes and establish its prowess as the service management plane and now, barely a year later, we are bursting with pride as we make this announcement.

**Meshery has officially been accepted into the CNCF landscape as a "Service Mesh"!**

Read about our journey in the words of one of our most valued contributors and proud Meshery user, Anton Weiss:
<div style="color:#808080;position:relative;top:-8px;font-size:1.00em;">"Open source contributions are a must-do for becoming a true cloud native hero. Cloud native is all about the community and one can't be a part of a community by only taking and never giving back. So if you were looking for a promising and welcoming project to join - look no further! <br> Hop on to Layer5 Slack and we'll happily embrace you and help you get started. And it's not only coding! Documentation, testing, UI design, logos, blogs, videos - you decide where to apply your talent."

desc: "<strong>Introduction to Istio - Decoupling at layer 5</strong><br>
Organizations that have adopted containers and are running a handful (or more) of microservices often find tools to provide observability, control, and security lacking. Service meshes—the third phase in the microservices journey—have quickly entered the cloud native landscape, filling unmet service-level needs and providing a substrate of secure connectivity, uniform visibility, and granular control over service requests. Operating at layer 5, service meshes offer great value.

Expert Lee Calcote walks you through each and every aspect of the open source service mesh Istio. Over three hours, you’ll gain hands-on experience with this popular tool as you learn how to deploy Istio alongside microservices running in Kubernetes.

<strong>What you'll learn-and how you can apply it</strong>
By the end of this live online course, you’ll understand:
<ul>
<li>- How to manage traffic through load balancing and resilient communications
<li>- How to enforce policies and rate limiting
<li>- Istio's methods for managing telemetry, monitoring, and reporting
<li>- Approaches to canary deployments and securing communication with Istio
</ul>
And you’ll be able to:
<ul>
<li>- Configure and operate Istio in context of an example workloads and their common use cases
<li>- Take the third step in your cloud native journey with an initial deployment of a service mesh
</ul>"

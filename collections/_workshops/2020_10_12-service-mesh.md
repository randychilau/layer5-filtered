name: Service Mesh Fundamentals with Linkerd
desc: "<strong>Service Mesh Fundamentals with Linkerd - Decoupling at layer 5</strong><br>
Organizations that have adopted containers and are running a handful (or more) of microservices often find tools to provide observability, control, and security lacking. Service meshes—the third phase in the microservices journey—have quickly entered the cloud native landscape, filling unmet service-level needs and providing a substrate of secure connectivity, uniform visibility, and granular control over service requests. Operating at layer 5, service meshes offer great value.

Lee Calcote walks you through advanced service mesh concepts and each and every aspect of the popular service mesh Linkerd. Over three hours, you’ll gain hands-on experience deploying Linkerd alongside microservices running in Kubernetes.

<strong>What you'll learn-and how you can apply it</strong>
By the end of this live online course, you’ll understand:
<ul>
<li>- Linkerd's methods for managing telemetry, monitoring, and reporting
<li>-  Approaches to canary deployments and securing communication with Linkerd
</ul>
And you’ll be able to:
<ul>
<li>- Configure and operate Linkerd in context of an example workloads and their common use cases
<li>-  Manage traffic through load balancing and resilient communications
<li>- Enforce policies and rate limiting
<li>- Be confident in the third step of your cloud native journey with ongoing management of your service mesh
</ul>

<h3>Purpose and Overview</h3>


The scope of this initiative includes all service mesh projects participating in the Service Mesh Interface specification. It’s important to acknowledge that conformance consists of both capabilities and compliance status.

<h4>Project Goals</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Provide users with a compatibility matrix identifying the SMI features that
    are supported per service mesh.
  </li>
  <li>
    An easy-to-use, service mesh and SMI-specific tool to give service mesh
    projects and users a suite of repeatable conformance tests.
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Project Objectives</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Define what it means to be in conformance with the SMI specifications.{" "}
  </li>
  <li>
    Define a set of conformance tests and what behavior is expected of a
    conforming service mesh implementation.
  </li>
  <li>Built into each participating service mesh project’s release tooling.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Validating Conformance</h4>

Conformance to SMI specifications will be done through use of a service mesh’s workload. A sample application is used as the workload to test. To facilitate a common set of tests, a sample application has been developed for purposes of providing a consistent workload to apply SMI specs against. A deployment of the <a href="https://github.com/layer5io/learn-layer5">Learn Layer5</a> sample application being fitted to each service mesh.

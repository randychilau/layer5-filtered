  Layer5 took part as one of the organisations that participated in the [She Code Africa Contribution](https://sites.google.com/shecodeafrica.org/Contribution) which started on April 1, 2021, 
  and it was indeed a pleasant and impactful experience for both the mentors and the mentees from [She Code Africa](https://www.shecodeafrica.org/).
  
  [The She Code Africa  Contribution](https://sites.google.com/shecodeafrica.org/Contribution) is an Africa wide Open source boot camp focused on building more women OSS contributors & creating more diversity in the African open source
  ecosystem by matching African women in technology with sponsors and mentors from Open Source organizations. During this Bootcamp, participants work with an open source 
  organisation on a project for 4weeks with the help of organisation mentors and get rewarded at the end of the Bootcamp upon successful project completion.

  During the Bootcamp, Layer5 received a total of 8 mentees all from Nigeria. These mentees were teamed up to work on the 3 project ideas selected by Layer5. Each project had an average of  2 members of the community who were delegated 
  as mentors to oversee the contributions of the mentees.

  The mentors were in constant communication with the mentees, taking their questions and rendering help when needed. At the end of the Contribution boot camp, 
  It was heartwarming to see the mentees were able to make noticeable contributions to the projects.  During the boot camp wrap up call, mentees gave presentations 
  that revealed how impactful it was for them working on Layer5 projects.
  
  
  <h3>Appreciation</h3>
  In gratitude, we acknowledge the commitment and contributions of the mentees toward the projects and we won't forget our incredible mentors who were devoted to 
  meeting the needs and answering to the mentees during this bootcamp. Also, we would like to appreciate <a href="https://twitter.com/zaycodes">Zainab Abubakar</a> for having facilitated the She Code Africa

## New Service Mesh Support

Two new Meshery service mesh adapters are bundled with this latest version of Meshery.

<h3>Meshery Adapter for Traefik Mesh (beta)</h3>
Traefik Mesh is a straight-forward, easy to configure, and non-invasive service mesh that allows visibility and management of the traffic flows inside any Kubernetes cluster.
<div style="display:flex;">
<img style="max-width:300px; width:20%;padding: 1.25rem;" src={Traefik} />
<ul>
  <li>Meshery supports Traefik Mesh lifecycle management and sample applications operations below</li>
  <li>Bookinfo, see the <a href="https://docs.meshery.io/guides/sample-apps#bookinfo">BookInfo Document</a></li>
  <li>HttpBin, see the <a href="https://docs.meshery.io/guides/sample-apps#httpbin">HttpBin Document</a></li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h3>Meshery Adapter for NGINX Service Mesh (alpha)</h3>
NGINX Service Mesh (NSM) is a fully integrated, lightweight service mesh that leverages a data plane powered by NGINX Plus to manage container traffic in Kubernetes environments. 
<div style="display:flex;">
<img style="max-width:300px; width:20%;padding: 1.25rem;" src={NGINXSM} />
  <ul>
    <li>Meshery support the lifecycle and performance management of NGINX Service Mesh lifecycle management and sample applications operations below</li>
    <li>Bookinfo, see the <a href="https://docs.meshery.io/guides/sample-apps#bookinfo">BookInfo Document</a></li>
    <li>HttpBin, see the <a href="https://docs.meshery.io/guides/sample-apps#httpbin">HttpBin Document</a></li>

<h3>Extensibility</h3>
As the service mesh manager, Meshery, is an extensible platform offering user and integrators well-crafted, extension points within which you may augment the behavior of Meshery. 

Dynamic injection of Remote Provider extensions
  * Designed to be pluggable
    * Pluggable UI functionality
    * Pluggable Backend functionality
    * Pluggable AuthZ
  * Offering points of extension to users/integrations to deliver enhanced functionality
    * Authentication and Authorization
    * Long-Term Persistence
    * Enhanced Visualization
    * Reporting
  * Two types of providers are designed in Meshery
    * Local provider
      * Built into Meshery
    * Remote provider
      * It can be implemented by anyone or any organization that wishes to integrate with Meshery


### MeshKit

<a href="https://github.com/layer5io/meshkit">MeshKit toolkit</a> aims to specifically focus on service mesh management and provides broadly useful functionality, it provides a standard policy for error handling and logging across all Meshery components, and implementations for error handling, logging, and tracing.
* MeshKit provides common data models of Service Mesh Interface conformance testing for Meshery.
* The low-level API abstract by MeshKit to the high-level functions provides out-of-the-box functions.


### Meshery Adapter Library

<p>The Meshery Adapter Library provides a common and consistent set of functionality for managing the lifecycle of service meshes and their workloads.</p>

* The library provides a set of interfaces, some with default implementations like a mini framework implementing the gRPC server that allows plugging in the mesh-specific configuration and operations implemented in the adapters.
* The default configuration provider we use Viper to reads the adapter specific configuration, and the configuration providers are implementations of an interface, this can be flexible if anyone wants to implement it on their own.

<h3>Meshery Operator</h3>
<div style="display:flex;">
<img style="max-width:300px; width:20%;padding: 1.25rem;" src={MesheryOperator} />

<ul>
  <li>We add new broker to meshery-operator <a href="https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-operator/pull/97">PR #97</a></li>
  <li>We split the source code of MeshSync from Meshery Operator  <a href="https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-operator/issues/88"> issue #88</a></li>
  <li>Meshery Operator is provides abilities includes cluster discovery, service-mesh discovery and data streaming via NATS.</li>
</ul>
</div>

  <a href={MesheryOperatorShot} style="background-color:rgba(255,255,255,0)"><img style=" width:50%;" src={MesheryOperatorShot} /></a>
</div>

<h3>MeshSync</h3>
<div style="display:flex;">
<img style="max-width:300px; width:20%;padding: 1.25rem;" src={MeshSync} />
<ul>
  <li>MeshSync is one of a family of custom controllers within Meshery Operator.</li>
  <li>We released it to a new project, welcome to contribute <a href="https://github.com/layer5io/meshsync">MeshSync</a></li>
  <li>It provides ability to detect service meshes and services deployed on the cluster, and snapshot stored in-memory and refreshed periodically; 
maintain the local snapshot of the cluster and refreshed periodically.</li>
  <li>These abilities above help Meshery operations more resilient.</li>
</ul>
</div>


### GraphQL Support

Meshery now supports <a href="https://docs.meshery.io/concepts/architecture#meshery-operator-and-meshsync">GraphQL instances</a> between Meshery UI and Meshery Server offering any GraphQL client the  power to ask for exactly what they need from mesh. This new API sets the stage preparing for  exciting features in upcoming releases. Extension points are also built into Meshery's GraphQL support allowing integrators to bring their own GraphQL resolvers to the Meshery server runtime.


### Meshery Databases

<a href="https://docs.meshery.io/concepts/architecture/database">Meshery databases</a> as repositories for MeshSync, user preferences, system settings, 
can be considered ephemeral and treated as caches. Meshery Database offers federated datasets for managing multiple Kubernetes cluster and multiple service meshes.
<div style="text-align:center;">
  <a href={MesheryDB}><img style=" width:50%;" src={MesheryDB} /></a>
</div>


### Meshery CLI
The beloved `mesheryctl` introduces new commands in the v0.5.0 release expanding the CLI's support of multiple Msehery deployments. 

`context` enables user to easy manage multiple Deployments of Meshery by quickly switching contexts. suporting deNew ‚Äúcontext‚Äù command in mesheryctl - Ability to manage and use multiple meshery environments / deployments in a single cli using contexts, inspired from kubectl contexts. (Doc #2112 and Doc #2274)

<p>
  <Link to="/service-mesh-management/meshery">Meshery</Link> took its first steps into the cloud native world in July of 2019 with the goal to ease the adoption and operation of cloud native infrastructure with a focus on service meshes as ubiquitious a layer within and outside of Kubernetes deployments. Since then, Meshery as a project and Layer5 as an open source community have grown by leaps and bounds. Now, we are bursting with pride in announcing that Meshery has reached yet another milestone: 1,000 stars on the Meshery repository on GitHub.
</p>

<p>
  As a project Meshery is comprised of about 30 repositories, and so, in total, the project has many more than a thousand stars. The rate by which Meshery is accumulating stars only continues to accelerate and is a small moment of pride recognized in the community Slack each time a star is added.

  As we hit the 1,000+ stars marker, let's pause to reflect on the project's incredible journey since its inception.
</p>

<h3>Why was Meshery created?</h3>
<p>
Meshery is as an open source, vendor-neutral, extensible management plane that to enable service mesh users to overcome the challenges of complex virtual networking, empowers them to design and apply patterns containing tried and true best practices, and enables developers, operators, and product managers to understand and their cloud native services with confidence. Meshery is the only openly-governed service mesh manager. Given its abilty to deeply manage Kubernetes, its workloads, and any service mesh, and the highly configurable way in which users can load a variety of plugins, the project has certainly  earned its title as the <i>extensible</i> service mesh manager.

  Within just a year of it's creation, <Link to="/company/news/meshery-accepted-into-the-cncf-landscape">Meshery lands in the CNCF Landscape</Link>.

<p>Not long after, Meshery was <Link to="/company/news/cncf-adopts-service-mesh-performance-standard-established-by-layer5">adopted by the CNCF</Link> in October 2021. With its natural step into the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, the contributor community and Meshery's functionality maintains steadfast in their rate of growth and use. With continuous improvements in the architecture, user experience and in other features regulated by inclusive monitoring, the project is gaining traction <i>very quickly</i>.

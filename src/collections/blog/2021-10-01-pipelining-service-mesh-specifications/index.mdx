Before jumping into how to leverage the service mesh specifications, let’s take a brief look into what these specs facilitate.

The [Service Mesh Interface](https://smi-spec.io/) specification provides a standard interface for service meshes on Kubernetes. It has a basic common denominator feature set to support most common service mesh use cases and a flexibility to support new service mesh capabilities over time.

The [Service Mesh Performance](https://smp-spec.io/) specification standardizes capturing and characterizing the details of infrastructure capacity, service mesh configuration and workload metadata.

As a service mesh agnostic tool that provides lifecycle and performance management of a large number (10+) service meshes, sample applications, service mesh patterns and WebAssembly filters, Meshery is the ideal tool for the job when it comes to implementing these specifications.

Meshery also comes with 2 new GitHub Actions that do exactly this. The [Meshery SMI Conformance Action](https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-smi-conformance-action) which [validates SMI conformance](https://meshery.io/blog/validating-smi-conformance-with-meshery) in your pipeline and the [Meshery SMP Action](https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-smp-action) which runs [SMP compatible performance benchmarks](https://docs.meshery.io/functionality/performance-management).

But how do we use these actions? What do they offer? Let’s find out!

## Meshery SMI Conformance Action

Conformance of SMI specifications are defined as a series of test assertions. These test assertions are categorised by SMI specification and comprise the complete suite of SMI conformance tests. The conformance requirements will change appropriately as each new version of the SMI spec is released.

Read more about Meshery and SMI conformance [here](https://docs.meshery.io/functionality/service-mesh-interface).

### Using the GitHub Action

You can get the action from [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/service-mesh-interface-conformance-with-meshery).

You can configure this action to run on releases or on every pull request.

An example of the action configuration which runs on every release is shown below. The action handles setting up a Kubernetes environment, deploying the service mesh (see supported service meshes), running the conformance tests and reporting back the results to the SMI Conformance dashboard in Meshery.

```yaml
name: SMI Conformance with Meshery
on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*'

jobs:
  smi-conformance:
    name: SMI Conformance
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:

      - name: SMI conformance tests
        uses: layer5io/mesheryctl-smi-conformance-action@master
        with:
          provider_token: ${{ secrets.MESHERY_PROVIDER_TOKEN }}
          service_mesh: open_service_mesh
          mesh_deployed: false
```

Users can also bring in their own cluster with specific capabilities and with a service mesh already installed.

```yaml
name: SMI Conformance with Meshery
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - 'master'

jobs:
  smi-conformance:
    name: SMI Conformance tests on master
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:

      - name: Deploy k8s-minikube
        uses: manusa/actions-setup-minikube@v2.4.1
        with:
          minikube version: 'v1.21.0'
          kubernetes version: 'v1.20.7'
          driver: docker

      - name: Install OSM
        run: |
           curl -LO https://github.com/openservicemesh/osm/releases/download/v0.9.1/osm-v0.9.1-linux-amd64.tar.gz
           tar -xzf osm-v0.9.1-linux-amd64.tar.gz
           mkdir -p ~/osm/bin
           mv ./linux-amd64/osm ~/osm/bin/osm-bin
           PATH="$PATH:$HOME/osm/bin/"
           osm-bin install --osm-namespace default

      - name: SMI conformance tests
        uses: layer5io/mesheryctl-smi-conformance-action@master
        with:
          provider_token: ${{ secrets.MESHERY_PROVIDER_TOKEN }}
          service_mesh: open_service_mesh
          mesh_deployed: true
```

Users can download a token from Meshery and add it as a GitHub secret (in the example above, the secret is MESHERY_PROVIDER_TOKEN).

<div class="img-center">
  <a href={token} style="background-color:rgba(255,255,255,0)"><img src={token} /></a>
</div>

After the test is run, you can view the results from the Service Mesh Interface dashboard in Meshery UI.

<div class="img-center">
  <a href={smidashboard} style="background-color:rgba(255,255,255,0)"><img src={smidashboard} /></a>
</div>

Participating service mesh projects can also [automatically report their conformance test results](https://docs.meshery.io/functionality/service-mesh-interface#reporting-conformance) to the [SMI Conformance dashboard](https://meshery.io/service-mesh-interface) automatically.

## Meshery SMP Action

Measuring and managing the performance of a service mesh is key to efficient operation of any service mesh.

Meshery is the canonical implementation of the Service Mesh Performance specification. Users can choose from multiple load generators and use a highly configurable set of load profiles with variable tunable facets to run a performance test.

Meshery packages all these features into an easy-to-use GitHub Action.

### Using the GitHub Action

The Meshery SMP Action is available in the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/performance-testing-with-meshery).

Users can create their own performance profiles to run repeatable tests with Meshery.

A sample configuration of the action is shown below.

```yaml
name: Meshery SMP Action
on:
  push:
    branches:
      'master'

jobs:
  performance-test:
    name: Performance Test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          ref: 'perf'

      - name: Deploy k8s-minikube
        uses: manusa/actions-setup-minikube@v2.4.1
        with:
          minikube version: 'v1.21.0'
          kubernetes version: 'v1.20.7'
          driver: docker

      - name: Run Performance Test
        uses: layer5io/meshery-smp-action@master
        with:
          provider_token: ${{ secrets.PROVIDER_TOKEN }}
          platform: docker
          profile_name: soak-test
```

Users can also define their test configuration in an SMP compatible configuration file as shown below.

```yaml
smp_version: v0.0.1
id:
name: Istio Performance Test
labels: {}
clients:
- internal: false
  load_generator: fortio
  protocol: 1
  connections: 2
  rps: 10
  headers: {}
  cookies: {}
  body: ""
  content_type: ""
  endpoint_urls:
  - http://localhost:2323/productpage
duration: "30m"
```

See [action.yml](https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-smp-action/blob/master/action.yml) for more configuration details.

The results from the tests are updated on the Performance Management dashboard in Meshery.

<div class="img-center">
  <a href={perfdashboard} style="background-color:rgba(255,255,255,0)"><img src={perfdashboard} /></a>
</div>

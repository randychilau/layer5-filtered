If you're in the Layer5 Community, no doubt, you've met <a href="/community/members/nikhil-ladha">Nikhil Ladha</a>. If not, join the community and get to know Nikhil. 

What can I say about Nikhil? I asked a few others

Nikhilâ€™s long history in the community, as I went to solicit 

In process of confirming Nikhil as the winner of the inaugural MeshMate of the Year award, we looked to the community for validation. Little did I realize that meant reaching out to nearly a hundred people, whom Nikhil has mentored or supported in their time in the Layer5 community. More than a few of them had something to say about their time with Nikhil:
<blockquote>
In the year and a half that I've known Nikhil
Nikhil's my friend. He is the Layer5 MeshMate of the Year.

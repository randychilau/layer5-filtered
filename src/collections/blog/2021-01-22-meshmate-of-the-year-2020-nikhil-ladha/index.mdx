If you're in the Layer5 Community, no doubt, you've met <a href="/community/members/nikhil-ladha">Nikhil Ladha</a>. If not, I recommend that you join the community and get to know Nikhil.

In process of confirming Nikhil as the winner of the inaugural MeshMate of the Year award, we looked to the community for validation. Little did I realize that meant reaching out to nearly a hundred people whom Nikhil has mentored or supported in the Layer5 community. More than a few of them had something to say about their time with Nikhil:

In the year and a half that Nikhil has been in the community, he has touched the lives of many people, including mine. I'm, Nikhil is my friend. He is the Layer5 MeshMate of the Year.

If you're in the Layer5 Community, no doubt, you've met <a href="/community/members/nikhil-ladha">Nikhil Ladha</a>. And if not, I recommend that you join the community and get to know Nikhil. Here's why - 

Nikhil consistently volunteers to uplift and support others in the community, freely sharing of his time and knowledge. His actions embody and espouse the culture of Layer5.

<h4>It's not easy being a MeshMate</h4>

<Blockquote quote="Congratulations to Nikhil on being our community maintainer superstar. He has done a great job on our new Layer5 site and is infinitely patient on communicating with everyone. So, I believe he can be a good community ambassador." person="Aisuko" />

The MeshMate logo is a point of pride for individuals participating in the program. We encourage you to wear your badge proudly and do your utmost to represent the values of Layer5 as you do.

And for the inaugural award, a new badge identifies our yearly award winner.

Only one person carries this badge today. I can only guess as to who this ribbon may be awarded to for 2021.

Find a sticking point for the mentee in the community and on a project, so that the mentee ultimately turns into a long-term contributor and Layer5 community member.

MeshMate mission accomplished. How the relationship continues from here with the mentee is a personal choice between the MeshMate and mentee. Understand that many mentees start out with the best of intentions, but that not all will make it to the end. Chin up, if this happens. Itâ€™s par for the course (to be expected).

<Blockquote quote="Hi Nikhil, congratulations for the MeshMate of the Year Award, a well-deserved honor for a distinguished gentleman. When I was having a look at the Layer5 community, your member experience blog post stood out and was one of the main reasons for me to join the community. Within the community, it is apparent that your guidance, support, and contributions are very much appreciated. Keep up the excellent work!" person="Michael" />

The MeshMate program pairs experienced Layer5 community members with community newcomers to ensure a smooth onboarding experience. There is a lot going in the Layer5 community. Projects and working groups move fast. MeshMates are committed to helping their mentees in identifying an area of the projects to engage within, working groups to join, growing their Cloud Native knowledge, and network of relationships. By connecting one-on-one, MeshMates will share tips on how to have the best community experience possible.


In process of confirming Nikhil as the winner of the inaugural MeshMate of the Year award, we looked to the community for validation. Little did I realize that meant reaching out to nearly a hundred people whom Nikhil has mentored or supported in the Layer5 community. More than a few of them had something to say about their time with Nikhil:


In the year and a half that Nikhil has been in the community, he has touched the lives of many people, including mine. I'm, Nikhil is my friend. He is the Layer5 MeshMate of the Year.



<Blockquote quote="Nikhil, your Meshery journey probably started in an unbuilt way. Each time you help others to start this awesome journey, you construct a better journey for all, a better way to help others. Thanks for everything!" 
person="Jesus" />

<Blockquote quote="Congratulations Nikhil. You deserve this title and more. You've been a continuous and steady force in the community and one of the sole reasons why any of our website codebases are still readable :)) I admire you both, as an engineer and as a person for the sheer amount of patience you show towards any new member. Thank you for always being a dependable pillar in the community!" person="Shriti" />

<Blockquote quote="Hey Nikhil, congratulations mate. It's been a long time coming. Honestly, how do you manage your time. I think it's safe to say that if it weren't for your reviews, half of the codebase in the Meshery-UI would be unreadable for new contributors, including my initial commits. Even though we haven't interacted much, you have been a great inspiration and I hope that you keep being that inspiration for others joining Layer5." person="Dhruv" />

<Blockquote quote="It is beautiful how you always try to respond to a message in the newcomer's channel and try to sort out issues or question asked. I can personally relate to your kind heart, on the particular times you got on a call with me as a newcomer then and helped me sort out my jekyll versus windows problem, being so patient and amazing. You really deserve this award Nikhil, and a big congratulations to you!" person="Prateek Tripathy" />

<Blockquote quote="Hi Nikhil. A big congratulations on being the MeshMate of the Year. You have been absolutely fantastic, I am so privileged to get in touch with you. I cannot count the number of times you have helped nervous and inexperienced newcomers like me get their first contributions to Layer5 and make it feel like one big family. Your name is a testimony for being 'complete' and you truly are a complete person. Thank you for everything you have done." person="Ruth" />

<Blockquote quote="Nikhil Ladha is a very knowledgeable person considering all the various contributions that he made to Meshery. He was also very kind to review something that I had written and provided feedback and suggestions to improve it. He once exhibited to the team one of his creations for which he had won an award. He is certainly a very great asset to the team both as a contributor and as a MeshMate." person="Vijay" />

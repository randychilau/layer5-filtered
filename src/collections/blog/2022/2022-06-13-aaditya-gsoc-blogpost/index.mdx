### Early Interest in Coding 
I grew up with an immense interest in computers. I used to be fascinated by how programs run on the computer that makes such an impact on the people using it. This always motivated me to work in the field of computers. 

As I grew up I was introduced to a broad spectrum of coding languages that enabled us to make the software that we used on the computer. These languages piqued my interest even more, and I started to explore and make projects. The more I understood them the more interesting it got. Slowly I realized that I just don’t want to make projects that satisfy my needs. I want to build something that will be on the internet and will be used by people around the world. With this goal in my mind, I started exploring and hit a gemstone that is Open source. I would be working on real-world programming solutions that will be used by people all around the world. This helped me to get started and got me excited about contributing to open-source projects. 

### First PR at Layer5 
I still remember the first issue I worked on for Layer5 was the auto labeler on a pull request. I saw a good first issue tag and still not knowing what the task was, I stated my interest to work on the issue. The issue required knowledge of GitHub Actions which at that time I didn’t even know there was such a thing. After getting the issue assigned, I started researching what GitHub Actions were. I found out that these actions helped to automate workflows that help in building, testing, and deploying software. After getting the basics down I looked for if there are any GitHub Actions already present for the auto labeling of the PR, and to my surprise, there were a couple of them. 

So before actually making a PR, I experimented with the Actions extensively in my private repo. I remember making about 20-25 PR in my private repo just to get the auto labeler working fine. After I verified I got the desired results, I made a PR. I also got to discuss my approach in the development call. I was so nervous at that time since that was the first meeting I attended where I had to make people understand what I did and what approaches I took. I was quite thrilled when my code got merged. I was enthralled to see that my code was working and being useful to the community. This motivated me to make more and more contributions.

### A Journey Never to forget 

With this small issue, my journey on Layer5 started. I gradually started learning about the project and started making some impactful contributions. I started to engage in the community more prominently. With the help of these contributions, I learned new technologies, and techniques. Contributing to the codebase gave me so much exposure to React.js, that it would not have been possible if I did it on my own. I took up issues that used React.js and started solving them, and in no time I was comfortable with it. I am thankful, that I didn’t wait for me to learn more about react and then start contributing. I have always applied this principle, learning more by doing actual stuff rather than sitting there and getting stuck in the tutorial loop. 

Another new technology I learned was Jekyll, which is a static site generator. This too was a technology that I had not heard about. I started contributing to issues involving Jekyll and slowly understood the basics and how the laguage works. I was very happy that I was able to make the [compatibility matrix](https://docs.meshery.io/project/compatibility-matrix), using Jekyll. Now even my project for GSoC is written in Jekyll. So, from not knowing what Jekyll is, to making some big changes, did make me happy. 

The community also helped me increase my confidence. The weekly meetings are responsible for this. The way the meeting required me to explain my fixes and give updates regarding the issues I was working on, helped me in getting vocal and comfortable with talking to various people.

I feel excited that I have been accepted as a Google Summer of Code Intern for this Summer of 2022. I am looking forward to contributing more and making an impact here. The project assigned to me is to make a dashboard at <a href="smp-spec.io/dashboard">SMP Website</a>. Here the results from the CNCF Cluster labs that run [here](https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-smp-action/actions) are to be shown graphically.  I also hope to learn more about Cloud Native technologies and make contributions on the backend too. I also want to state that this will not be the end. I will be engaged with this community as long as I can and will try to give back as much as I can. 

### Appreciation for the Community 

I finally would like to thank the Layer5 Community for being such an amazing help when I would get stuck on some issue. I learned one very important thing here, there is always something you can learn and there is no harm in asking stuff if you don’t know. It’s kinda hard to find such a welcoming community, there was not a day that I felt completely lost here and that is what I adore about this community. 

Keep Meshing Thank you

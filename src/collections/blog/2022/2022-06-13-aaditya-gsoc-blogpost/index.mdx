### Early Interest in Coding

I grew up with an immense interest in computers. I used to be fascinated by how programs run on the computer that makes such an impact on the people using it. This always motivated me to work in the field of computers.

As I grew up I was introduced to a broad spectrum of coding languages that enabled us to make the software that we used on the computer. These languages piqued my interest even more, and I started to explore and make projects. The more I understood them the more interesting it got. Slowly I realized that I just don’t want to make projects that satisfy my needs. I want to build something that will be on the internet and will be used by people around the world. With this goal in my mind, I started exploring and hit a gemstone that is Open source. I would be working on real-world programming solutions that will be used by people all around the world. This helped me to get started and got me excited about contributing to open-source projects.

### First PR @ Layer5

I still remember the first issue I worked on for Layer5 was the auto labeler on a pull request. I saw a good first issue tag and still not knowing what the task was, I stated my interest to work on the issue. The issue required knowledge of GitHub Actions which at that time I didn’t even know there was such a thing. This is one amazing thing about open source, there is a community that is always there to help you. After doing some self-research and asking folks in the community I was finally able to solve the issue. I still remember the excitement when my PR got merged. I was enthralled to see that my code was actually working and being useful to the community. This motivated me to make more and more contributions.

### A Journey Never to forget
With this small issue, my journey on Layer5 started. I gradually started learning about the project and started making some impactful contributions. I started to engage in the community more prominently. With the help of these contributions, I learned so many new technologies, and techniques. Not to mention the community also helped me increase my confidence. The weekly meetings are responsible for this. The way the meeting required me to explain my fixes and give updates regarding the issues I was working on, helped me in getting vocal and comfortable with talking to various people.

I feel really excited that I have been accepted as a Google Summer of Code Intern for this Summer of 2022. I am looking forward to contributing more and making an impact here. I also want to state that this will not be the end. I will be engaged with this community as long as I can and will try to give back as much as I can.

### Appreciation for the Community
I finally would like to thank the Layer5 Community for being such an amazing help when I would get stuck on some issue. I learned one very important thing here, there is always something you can learn and there is no harm in asking stuff if you don’t know. It’s kinda hard to find such a welcoming community, there was not a day that I felt completely lost here and that is what I adore about this community.


Keep Meshing

Thank you

  is a distinction that Layer5 awards select members of the community who innately
  align with our culture of helping others, paying it forward, and a commitment to
  knowledge sharing. MeshMates are Layer5 mentors and ambassadors (not employees).

  quote="Congratulations on the MeshMate of the Year Award, Nikhil, a well-deserved honor for a distinguished gentleman. When I was having a look at the Layer5 community, your member experience blog post stood out and was one of the main reasons for me to join the community. Within the community, it is apparent that your guidance, support, and contributions are very much appreciated. Keep up the excellent work!"

<p>
  A Layer5 MeshMate is individual who has consistently demonstrated their
  commitment to helping community members. The MeshMate program pairs
  experienced Layer5 community members with community newcomers to ensure a
  smooth onboarding experience. Helping community members takes all forms from
  ensuring the member has access to resources, is introduced to others,
  understands the vision and goals of projects, can build and contribute to
  projects, can use projects and have their feedback heard. MeshMates aid in
  identifying areas of projects and activities within the community to engage
  within, which working groups to join, and in help community members grow in
  their open source and cloud native knowledge.
</p>

<p>
  There is a lot going in the Layer5 community. Projects and working groups move
  fast. By connecting one-on-one, MeshMates share tips on how to have the best
  community experience possible, but also build a relationship with the
  community member inevitably leaving a lasting mark as is evident from member
  comments about Aditya.
</p>

<h3 style="padding:2rem 0;">It's not easy being a MeshMate</h3>

<p>
  With thousands of members in the Layer5 community, many come and go. Many take
  and many give. While we hope that each and every individual that joins will
  find a fit in the community and/or on a project, this isn't always the case.

  Engaging with and investing in community members can be taxing on mentors in
  terms of both their time and their emotional investment in seeing the newcomer
  plant roots, grow, and blossom.
</p>

<p>
  One of the goals MeshMates have is that of enabling the newcomer's passion and
  finding their sweetspot in the community and on a project, so that the
  newcomer ultimately achieves their goals - goals that are often similar, but
  different for each person. To help them acheive their goals, each individual
  is engaged 1:1 by their Meshmate, supporting them in becoming a landstanding
  Layer5 community member and contributor. MeshMates understand that many
  mentees start out with the best of intentions, but that not all overcome their
  hurdles in finding an area of the community to call home or aspect of a
  project to own.

<h3 style="padding:2rem 0;">MeshMates are a massive force</h3>
<p>
  In just a year's time, with thousands of people in the Layer5 community and
  500+ contributors to our projects, it's clear that Layer5 MeshMates
  significantly uplift our collaborative efforts and are steady force in the
  community. In process of confirming Aditya as the winner of the 
  MeshMate of the Year award, we looked to the community for validation. Little
  did I realize that meant reaching out to nearly a hundred people whom Aditya
  has mentored or supported in the Layer5 community. More than a few of them had
  something to say about their time with Aditya:

  As displayed on <Link to="/community/member/nikhil-ladha">Nikhil Ladha</Link>'s profile, the inaugral winner of the MeshMate of the Year award, the MeshMate of the Year badge....
  
  
  Needs updated... In recognition a year's worth of paying it forward, and for the 
  award, a new badge identifies our MeshMate of the Year award winner. Only one
  person carries this badge today. I can only guess as to who this ribbon may be
  awarded to for 2022. In the year and a half that Aditya has been in the
  community, he has touched the lives of many people, including mine. Aditya is
  my friend. He is the Layer5 MeshMate of the Year.

<p>
  The MeshMate badge is a point of pride for individuals participating in the
  program and looked upon with admiration and veneration by many within and
  external to the Layer5 community.
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
  Wear your MeshMate of the Year badge proudly, Aditya.

It all started with my curiosity to find an open source project with open issues with DevOps and CI/CD labels on them. 
While I was searching that on GitHub, I found <Link to="/service-mesh-management/meshery">Meshery</Link>, one of the projects at Layer5. I started going through the 
[README](https://github.com/meshery/meshery#readme) and it just felt like that's it. 
It integrates with all kinds of technologies that I always wanted to learn and explore. Then I jumped onto their [slack](http://slack.layer5.io/) and got even 
more excited by the enthusiasm and energy with which the community members welcomed me in the Newcomers channel. I started attending all the community meetings 
and learnt about the project through the demos/updates from fellow contributors. Slowly and gradually I started contributing too, started giving updates in the 
community calls and consequently started climbing the contributor ladder.

When I got to know that I will be working on Meshery Cloud and Meshery as an LFX intern at Layer5, I just couldn’t control my excitement. 
That excitement was to ship more impactful features for the Layer5 projects, work and engage more deeply with the engineering team at Layer5 and have an overall 
upliftment of my development skills. Throughout my internship I worked on several features. Few on the top of the list are as follows, expanding 
[Meshery extension points](https://docs.meshery.io/extensibility), exposing node details of the K8s clusters on which Meshery runs <Link to="/projects/service-mesh-performance">performance tests</Link>, supporting [Cilium service mesh adapter](https://github.com/meshery/meshery-cilium) with Meshery, 
persisting <Link to="/meshmap">MeshMap</Link> user preferences with Meshery Cloud, migrating Meshery Cloud UI to NextJS, support for user profile on Meshery Cloud and 
exposing performance profiles (generated from Meshery performance tests that run on CNCF hosted runners through [meshery-smp-action](https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-smp-action)) 
through a public facing API.

In terms of learning curve, I learned so much that the knowledge I gained in the past 3 months surely overpowers that education I receieved in the last 2 years of college, 
if we put in context the applicability of each of the learnings in the software industry. 
I learned and applied tech stack from Golang, GraphQL, NextJS to Postgres, SQL, GoBuffalo to GitHub actions. I was exposed to the topics like 
performance engineering, service meshes, networking and several cloud native tools, and got introduced to several experienced developers who are very involved in the 
communities that revolve around these realms.

One of the major realization I got through this internship was that it’s okay to make mistakes. There were several instances throughout the internship where 
I made mistakes or couldn’t deliver, what I was asked for, in one go. For instance, once I forgot to add pagination in an SQL query and that depressed the whole 
production instance of Meshery Cloud which means no one would be able to log into Meshery until that’s fixed. Or once I unknowingly used incorrect default SSH port 
in a workflow which failed a GitHub action responsible for pushing the latest Meshery Cloud image to Docker Hub and then updating the deployment in AWS VM. But 
that's okay and no one got mad at me for that, and rather I alway received constructive feedback. I did learn from each mistake and made sure that I don’t repeat 
it because that's all that matters.

I had a great time interning at Layer5. Each day brought new challenges and a desire to raise PR with great features. I not only learned how to fix bugs but also 
learned how to avoid them in the first place. I not only learned hard skills but also learned soft skills. I not only learned the meaning of self-reliance but also 
learned the true meaning of team spirit. 
All in all it was one of the most exquisite experiences I’ve ever had and of course the best internship experience (considering the fact that it was my first internship ever). 

I will be engaged in the community and keep contributing to Layer5 projects as much as possible.

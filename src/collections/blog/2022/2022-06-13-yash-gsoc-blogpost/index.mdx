### My Early days with OpenSource

I have been contributing to open source for some time now and have learned many new things. GSoC was where I learned about open source and then learned about many other open-source programs. In the starting Getting into one of the programs was my sole reason for contributing to open source, but as I started contributing, I found out how great open source is. I learned so many new things and got to work with so many amazing people. I enjoyed contributing so much that  I even forgot to apply to many programs, which was my sole reason to start contributing. I applied in GSoC 30mins before the deadline, and guess what, I got selected.

### My OpenSource Experience

I still remember how nervous I was when I started open source. Open source is like riding a bicycle, it takes a little extra force to start, but as you start contributing, it turns into a fun ride. And when you find a great project and community, it gives you an extra push in contributing. In my case, I found Layer5, one of the most welcoming communities I found. As soon as you drop-in Layer5â€™s slack, you get welcomed by many other fellow contributors. There are always people around to help you if you get stuck anywhere. I recently visited my first issue in Layer5 to find out the issue being so simple and so many great memories flew through me. I still remember the feeling when my first pr was merged I was in seventh heaven, I still love that purple and want a daily dose of that. Sometimes, I visit my old PRs to soothe my mind to see that purple.Layer5 taught me so many things I doubt I would be able to learn somewhere else. The support I was given by the community was just remarkable
 
### Waiting for the Exciting Future

I feel really excited that I have been accepted as a Google Summer of Code Intern for this Summer of 2022. I am looking forward to learning a lot and contributing more. I also want to state that this will not be the end. I will contribute to this community as long as I can and try to give back as much as possible.
 
Thank You

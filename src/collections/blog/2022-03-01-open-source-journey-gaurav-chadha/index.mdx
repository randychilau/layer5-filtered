<p>
  HeyðŸ‘‹, I am Gaurav Chadha, a student from New Delhi, India with lots of dreams, ambitions, and zeal to learn and grow more each and every day.
</p>
<h2 id="journey">How did it all begin?</h2>
<p>
My journey in Open source started with late-night surfing on LinkedIn,
I saw a post about Layer5 organization and open-source which drove me to their website and slack channel, and then Boom my one click to join @Layer5's slack workspace kickstarted my journey in Open Source.
I would say this was my best ever decision in life till now.
</p>
<h2 id="firs-pr">Getting started in the community</h2>
<p>
As soon as I joined Later5's slack workspace, I landed on different slack channels workspace, At first I was a bit shy to introduce myself on the #introduction channel but then I saw many other folks introducing themselves. My inner voice aksed, "If they can do it, why can't I?", so I went ahead and introduced myself to the community. 
The best part here in Layer5 is each and every newcomer is warmly welcomed and 
they also have a dedicated  Newcomers Call which helped them to get started with the project and to know more about how the community works.
</p>
<p>
  I would highly recommend all the newcomers to engage as much as possible in the community, you will gradually start seeing a change in yourself.
</p>

<h3 id="first-pr">Way to my First Pull Request</h3>
<p>
I still remember at that time I was just a beginner with Git, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and most of the issues on the repository were going over my head. 
So I started with a very beginner-friendly issue about changing a background of a component and who would have thought this changing background issue will eventually change my life in open source. 
Then I made my first ever pull request in Layer5 and that got merged!
</p>
<h3 id="more-prs">From 1 Pull Request to 80+ Pull Requests Merged</h3>
<p>
 After my first pull request got merged I really got pumped up with joy and told myself that I can do more. This journey of learning and pull requests was not at all easy for me, it took almost 9 months of continuous dedication and effort. There are many great folks I met here in the community, who helped me and taught me new interesting concepts. 
 A big thanks to all of them, this was not possible without their guidance and support.
</p>
<h2 id="learnings-at-Layer5">Things I learned at Layer5</h2>
<p>
   There are a variety of things I learned at Layer5 and a lot I'm learning currently. I gained much technical knowledge as well as soft skills in these 9 months. I spend most of my time working on the UI of Meshery and its various projects. 
   In terms of technical items I learned React, Docker, Kubernetes, new JavaScript concepts, etc.
</p>
<p>
  I would say Layer5 is the best in terms of work ethics, community management, a healthy work environment, and a lot more. 
  You can gain real-life working experience on such big projects and guidance related to your career.
</p>
<h2 id="apart-from-coding">Apart from coding</h2>
<p>
  Besides coding at Layer5, I made many new friends, great experiences, and memories.
</p>
<p>
  At last, I would say, join this amazing community and experience the change in yourself. This will open the doors for opportunities for you. Just be tenacious and push yourself, that's all that I did.
</p>
<p>
  Thank you

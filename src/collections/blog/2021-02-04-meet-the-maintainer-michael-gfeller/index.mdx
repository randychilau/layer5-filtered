<div class="intro"><p>Kicking off Layer5's Meet the Maintainer series, we have Michael Gfeller. Michael is an avid research enthusiast in addition to holding the title of Chief Engineer at his day job. With exhaustive interests ranging from software architecture to systems security, he has been working with cloud architecture for the past four years.
</p><p>
In his relatively short tenure at Layer5, Michael has already delivered a wave of meshy contributions enhancing the Meshery adapters and improving upon Meshery’s architecture. With a penchant for looking behind the curtain and tightening loose cogs until they run to perfection, Michael has taken his place as a significant contributor to Meshery and has enabled the project to improve at an impressive pace.

Michael, thank you for joining me today. This certainly isn’t our first conversation, and many in the Layer5 community have seen your work, but may not know the backstory as to who Michael is and how you arrived at the position you currently hold. Indulge us. How did you come across the Layer5 community? What made you stay?
</p></div>

"Hey Shriti, thank you for having me. If I remember correctly, I was looking for a professional focus area earlier this year, and landed on service meshes. I had worked with service meshes before, which helped piquedpeak my initial interest. I had worked with Istio as part of my work for some time, and in the same context I stumbled across Meshery. I wasn’t able to dig deep back then but the concept sounded fascinating to me. Additionally, I had been benefiting from open source, both personally and professionally for a long time, but apart from a few minor contributions, I had never been able to give back to the community. I hoped to correct that."
</p>
<p>
"I re-discovered Meshery and the Layer5 community, listened to a recording of a Meshery community meeting, and read a couple of blog posts describing the community and member experience posts. One that stood out for me was a post by Nikhil Ladha. Going by his words, it appeared to be a warm, diverse and active community. My suspicions were confirmed when I joined. Layer5 offers a wholesome, interactive community in addition to unbiasedly providing help and guidance around the virtual corner."
</p></div>

<div class="interviewer">
<span>Shriti:</span>
<p>
You’ve been consistently contributing to a large number of Layer5 projects (Meshery adapters, mesheryctl, SMI, SMP). Layer5 has a large collection of active projects. Which one are you currently focusing on? 
Psst. Which one’s your favorite? I won’t tell.
</p></div>

<div class="interviewee">
<span>Michael:</span>
<p>
"I’m a technical architect and programmer, which made the backend, especially the adapters, a natural choice for me. It involves both contributing to the management plane, but also looking at and using service meshes from an architectural point of view. The possible implementations of service meshes is an area that has been particularly fascinating for me."
</p>
<p>
"I’d probably continue to work with the Meshery adapters for now before moving on to other areas of the project. Haha, I would probably name the Meshery Adapter Library as my favorite Layer5 project till date."
</p></div>

<div class="interviewer">
<span>Shriti:</span>
<p>Have you worked with any other open source project? How does Layer5 compare?
</p></div>

<div class="interviewee">
<span>Michael:</span>
<p>
"I have worked and collaborated with several open source communities before, including Eclipse Modelling Framework and Apache ServiceMix . I couldn’t possibly make a very accurate comparison, given by limited interaction with other communities, but the Layer5 community stands out based on the unique and extremely inclusive approach it takes towards upholding community values."
</p></div>

<div class="interviewer">
<span>Shriti:</span><p>
What is so fascinating about service meshes?
</p></div>

<div class="interviewee">
<span>Michael:</span><p>
"I find meshes intriguing in general. Meshes can look intricate, layered and complicated at a first glance, and yet they are built on the most basic principles. For me, meshes are visual structures, complete with an aesthetic and artistic dimension. "
</p>
<p>
"Fun Fact: Overlapping meshes resulting in Moiré patterns are an example of this. They appealed to me from a young age, and I learned about their mathematics from my mathematics teacher."
</p></div>

<div class="interviewer">
<span>Shriti:</span><p> 
Fascinating. Why did you pick service meshes specifically though? 
</p></div>

<div class="interviewee">
<span>Michael:</span><p>
"An increasing number of applications nowadays consist of distributed services, both in the  cloud and on-premises, in mixed and hybrid environments.  Many legacy applications are in express need of modernisation, consuming and being consumed by cloud native applications.  Introducing microservices, also by refactoring monolithic applications, increases the complexity of the service landscape. By delegating cross-cutting infrastructure concerns like security, traffic management, resilience, and observability to the services mesh, some of the complexity is moved from the applications to the service mesh, allowing application developers to focus on business logic. A concern in these distributed, dynamic and scalable systems is that the security also needs to scale. If security doesn’t scale, it becomes very challenging to handle such systems. Services meshes today are already able to support many of these scenarios, and are continuously improving."
</p>
<p>
"Service meshes are complex but that is something I enjoy attempting as a challenge, to have control and overview and make it appear simple, investing into automating options. Another field that I’m excited to learn about continuously is related to  the security of distributed systems, and how service meshes contribute to implementing a  zero trust network architecture."
</p>

<p>
"I actually dreamed about service mesh a while ago. That was almost a bit spooky.”</p> 
[Michael tweeted about this. The tweet will be added here]
</div>

<div class="interviewer">
<span>Shriti:</span><p>
Haha. Leading on that, what should Meshery dream about next? What can we hope to contribute to the service mesh landscape in your opinion?</p>
</div>

<div class="interviewee">
<span>Michael:</span><p> 
"Meshery currently does a great job of providing a neutral platform. Continuing in that direction would be a superb base plan.  Enabling innovative applications from vendors, supporting all service meshes, integrating best practice methods, and implementing the SMP and SMI abstractions would probably score the top five positions in Meshery’s new year resolutions in 2021."
</p>
</div>

<div class="interviewer">
<span>Shriti:</span><p>
Interesting. Do expand on that. What do you think Meshery could offer, in addition to what it already does?
</p>
</div>

<div class="interviewee">
<span>Michael:</span><p> 
"At the moment, Meshery provides a management plane solution and works on providing and testing with the SMI and SMP specifications. Helpful additions in the future should be the configuration based best practices, especially with regards to security and to possibly extend to owning up specific routes on security. For instance by verifying that the recommendations outlined in the NIST report  “Building Secure Microservices-based Applications Using Service-Mesh Architecture” by Ramaswamy Chandramouli and Zack Butcher are implemented.  A NIST paper I recently read expands on what I just said."
</p>
</div>

<div class="interviewer">
<span>Shriti:</span><p>
What are today's challenges when working with service meshes?
</p>
</div>

<div class="interviewee">
<span>Michael:</span><p>
“I can’t claim to have worked with many implementations, and to have a good overview and wide experience. A lot of the complexity is already handled, but there is still enough to decide and implement for each solution. The solution makes for a challenging but highly interesting task. Additionally, there are a variety of different solutions from different vendors, which is excellent but it also makes it hard to know which would be the best fit for a given situation. Here, again, Meshery can be of invaluable help.”
</p>
</div>

<div class="interviewer">
<span>Shriti:</span><p>
That’s good to hear. What do you think we should look forward to with respect to service mesh development?
</p>
</div>

<div class="interviewee">
<span>Michael:</span><p> The service mesh promise holds a lot of potential, for instance for modernization and ease of use. A lot appears to be happening these times. It will be interesting to see how serverless solutions will be integrated. Enabling a seamless implementation experience for solutions embracing multi-cloud, on-prem and legacy systems is also something to look forward to. Additionally, service meshes are aimed at making your architecture more secure and stable, which makes security a big concern for any service mesh provider. Improvements along these points will be topics I’ll be watching out for over the next few years.

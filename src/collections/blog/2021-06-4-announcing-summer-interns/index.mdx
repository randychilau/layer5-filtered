      Layer5 engages in many
      <Link className="blog" to="/careers/programs">Open Source Internship Programs</Link> looking for individuals who
      have potential to steward the culture and principles of Layer5. Take a look at the journey of few of those
      individuals.</p>

    Open-source has been intriguing to me, ever since I had joined my college's open-source community <a
      href="https://github.com/devlup-labs/">(DevlupLabs)</a>. It
    was in the middle of the pandemic, with my mind trying to find an escape, that I stumbled upon Layer5, and in that
    week itself I had a PR up and found myself demo'ing it in the very next community meeting. It was a very minor PR
    (in retrospect), making some UI changes for Meshery. With a very welcoming and helpful community and so many things
    to explore, there was no turning back.
  </p>
  <p>
    I started learning more about the projects in Layer5 and its tech stack. From how Meshery Backend was working and
    using gRPC and protobufs to communicate with its service mesh adaptors and define the <a
      href="https://layer5.io/projects/service-mesh-interface-conformance">SMI</a> and <a
      href="https://layer5.io/projects/service-mesh-performance">SMP</a> spec, to how
    Meshery UI leveraged some awesome libraries like NextJS, BillboardJS, and Redux; It has been through contributing to
    each of these areas, that I have learned each of these technologies more deeply and it was all possible because of
    the continuous influx of awesome support from the community, especially <a
      href="https://layer5.io/community/members/abishek-kumar">Abishek Kumar</a> (probably won't stop poking
    this guy anytime soon).
  </p>
  <p>
    Well, there are 3 months ahead of us, and for my part, I'll be working on a visual topology to help service mesh
    operators map their deployments, model their application performance, and parse their service proxy logs. I am ready
    to make an impact, learn more, and help other community members ( given you have completed the Layer5 ritual of
    giving an awkward first-timer introduction in our Community Call :p)

    It all started with an idea, the idea of doing open source contributions. And with that after scrolling through many
    Open Source Communities, I found Layer5, jumped up into slack, started learning about Meshery and raised a PR and
    felt like a rockstar, Started communicating to people, learnt more about meshery and mesheryctl with each
    contribution. And you know, once someone knows the taste of a PR getting merged, there’s no going back.
    <br />
    And at the time of writing this, it’s been almost three months or more. Before being accepted as GSoC Student, I had
    been working with Layer5 as a contributor, exploring Layer5’s Meshery and it’s cli-client Mesheryctl.
    <br />
    And so, we reach the beginning of my GSoC 2021 program, which began on the night of May 17th, 2021 when I learned
    that I had been selected as a GSoC Participant with the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). I am hyped up and
    excited to go ahead with Layer5 for the upcoming months.

  </p>
  <p>
    My GSoC project is about introducing some not-so-futuristic but interesting and important features to Meshery Server
    and Mesheryctl. Such as automating Documentation and Interactive playground for Meshery Server’s REST API endpoints,
    Adding commands related to performance testing and enhancing meshery’s environment health checking, introducing unit
    testing for mesheryctl, and CI/CD and Documentation for all the new features.
    <br />
    It has been 2 weeks since I have started my GSoC’21 tenure with the Layer5 community, and from the very beginning(I
    mean before GSoC), I have learned a lot with my code contributions and the Community here. I began with setting up
    the performance command under mesheryctl and Open API Specification 2.0 for REST API documentation to the project.
    <br />
    I am learning a lot of new things, like Unit Testing, Open API Specification, and much more to include.

    I got to know about Layer5 last year in December when one of my batchmates told me that he was contributing to the
    community. He asked me if I wanted to join slack and wanted to contribute to a project. So I looked at the projects
    on github and some open issues that I could contribute to. Me being a frontend developer I saw an issue related to
    removing whitespaces and minor frontend changes. I just made a PR and it was merged then I joined the slack channel
    and attended the #NewComers meeting. I was introduced to a lot of things that I could work on. All of them felt
    amazing and interesting, all I had to do was “signal” and I could work on any one of them.
    <br />
    At first I thought that I should just work on layer5.io or maybe getNightHawk, but then I was given an opportunity
    to work on something that I had never done before. It has been around 4 months that I have been a part of the
    community and I am actively trying to add to the project attending weekly meetings where everyone shares amazing
    stuff about what they did.
  </p>
  <p>
    As I said earlier my project is something that I had never worked on before, very interesting to work on, it adds
    one of the most important and unique features to Meshery. The Meshery Visual Topology that enables users to
    visualize their service meshes, look at important statistics. It also enables users to design their own service
    meshes by either importing their designs from a yaml file or by dragging and dropping service mesh components into a
    canvas, creating edges, grouping components, persisting these designs to see or edit later, realizing these designs
    by actually deploying them as service meshes and a lot more.
    <br />
    My job is to be the cytoscape god who knows every nook and cranny of the library that enables us to create the
    visual topology.
    <br />
    It's been a week since I have started my LFX internship and I have been working on visual topology even before that.
    These months of contributing code have taught me a lot. The first task that was given to me was to explore the
    CytoscapeJS library and demonstrate a proof of concept of animated edges between 2 components. I sat for 3 hours
    straight right after the community meeting creating the demo and posted a video on our slack. I was never
    appreciated better than on that day. I have never looked back since, each time I am given a feature or issue or any
    request I try my hardest to realize it in the earliest. I am constantly trying to improve myself and add to the
    project.

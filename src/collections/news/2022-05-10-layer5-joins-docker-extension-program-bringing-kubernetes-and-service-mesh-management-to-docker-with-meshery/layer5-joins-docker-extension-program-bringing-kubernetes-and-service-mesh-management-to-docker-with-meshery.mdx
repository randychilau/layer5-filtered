<p className="pull-left">From its genesis, Meshery has natively supported Docker as a deployment platform. With the Meshery Docker Extension the ability for developers to access a Kubernetes environment complete with a service mesh like Consul, Linkerd, Kuma, Istio, and so on. Meshery's <a href="https://docs.meshery.io/concepts/architecture/adapters">deep support for the Cilium Service Mesh</a> is the project's latest service mesh adapter.</p>

<p>"As a <a href="https://www.docker.com/blog/docker-captain-take-5-lee-calcote/">Docker Captain</a>, I have always been a proponent of Docker, and in particular its enablement of developer workflows", said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/leecalcote">Lee Calcote</a>, Founder and CEO of Layer5. "Now, Docker Extensions bring an integrated experience with ecosystem tooling, like <Link to="/meshery">Meshery</Link> - a critical tool for developers, who are configuring and managing cloud native applications."</p>

<p><img src={meshmapextension} alt="MeshMap Docker Extension" />The new extension brings <Link to="/meshmap">Layer5 MeshMap</Link>, the world's only visual designer for Kubernetes and service mesh deployments, to the desktop of millions of developers. Developers and operators alike can visually configure and operate their cloud native infrastructure and applications using MeshMap's low code visual designer.</p>

“Docker is obsessed with developer ergonomics and is committed to filling and improving the developer experience gap,” said Webb Stevens, Docker’s SVP of Secure Software Supply Chain. “We welcome Layer5 to the Docker Extension marketplace, expanding the applications and capabilities available for millions of registered Docker developers.”

Importantly, the Meshery Docker Extensions provides these significant features directly to Docker users:

<p><strong>Kubernetes and service mesh support for your Docker Compose apps</strong> - Import your Docker Compose apps. Configure and deploy them to Kubernetes and any service mesh.</p>

<p><strong>Visual design of Kubernetes applications</strong> - Using <Link to="/meshmap">MeshMap</Link> as a visual topology for designing Docker Compose applications, operating Kubernetes, service meshes, and their workloads.</p>

<p><strong>Single-click deployment of any service mesh</strong> - Support of 10 different service meshes to the fingertips of developers in connection with Docker Desktop’s ability to deliver Kubernetes locally.</p>

<p><strong>Detection of Kubernetes environments -</strong> Scan your kubeconfigs and select your current Kubernetes environment. Switch from one environment to another one.</p>

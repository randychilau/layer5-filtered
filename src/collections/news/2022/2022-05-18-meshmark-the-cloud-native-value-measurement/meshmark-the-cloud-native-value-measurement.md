description: "Layer5, a provider of cloud native management software, announced today the general availability of the Meshery Docker Extension. Complementing Docker Desktop's role as the go-to Kubernetes environment for cloud native developers, the Meshery Docker Extension provides easy access to the next layer of cloud native infrastructure: service meshes. As an inaugural Docker Extensions Partner and a maker of industry-defining, cloud native software, Layer5’s integration of Meshery provides a visual pathway for existing Docker Compose applications to move into Kubernetes and onto any service mesh."

VALENCIA, Spain (May 18th, 2022) - ServiceMeshCon EU /KubeCon EU - <a href="https://smp-spec.io/meshmark">MeshMark</a> is a performance index that measures the value and overhead of your cloud native environment. By converting performance measurements into insights about the value of individual, cloud native application networking functions, MeshMark distills a variety of overhead signals and key performance indicators into a simple index to facilitate quick and common comprehension.
</p>
<p>
A wall of performance metrics causes confusion, not clarity. “Performance measurement data rarely provides a clear and simple picture of how well our applications are performing from a business point of view, which are so often the key efficiency indicators that we really need”, says Ken Owens, Vice President Cyber Cloud Security Engineering at Fiserv.
</p>

<p>
By specifying a uniform way to analyze and report on the degree to which measured performance provides business value, MeshMark converts these metrics into insights about the efficiency and value of the functions your cloud native infrastructure is providing to your applications and services.
</p>

<h2>Service Mesh Performance, the project</h2>
<p>
Adopted by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) in October of 2021, Service Mesh Performance is an open source standard for service mesh efficiency, a growing consideration for cloud native operators and developers utilizing a service mesh in their infrastructure. With the myriad service meshes available and their sophisticated configurations, distributed systems efficacy and performance management is a continuous concern.
</p>
<p>
With project maintainers from Layer5, Intel, HashiCorp, and Red Hat, and collaborators from Isovalent, Buoyant, and FiServ, Service Mesh Performance is a vendor neutral cloud native performance measurement standard.

  quote="Many cloud native adopters have been put off from using service mesh due to the extra resource consumption and complexity that it can involve. We welcome MeshMark as an objective measure of that overhead, to help drive efficiency and make it easier for users to compare service mesh options."

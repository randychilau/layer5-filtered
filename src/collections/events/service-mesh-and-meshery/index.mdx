Engineers adopting microservice architectures are quickly faced with distributed systems challenges and in need of implementing rate limiting, circuit breaking, timeouts, retries, and implementing metrics, logging and tracing into each service is no simple task. Enter the service mesh.

Letâ€™s talk about:
What is a service mesh? Why do you need one?
What types of service meshes are available? How do they contrast?

Learn how Meshery, a CNCF Project, multi-service mesh management plane implements the service mesh specifications, Service Mesh Performance (SMP) and Service Mesh Interface (SMI), to empower users to manage more than 10 service meshes simultaneously.

Understand how Meshery uses a catalog of Service Mesh Patterns to provide templates for best practice configurations and how you can design new patterns with the visual topology designer, MeshMap

Benefits to the ecosystem:

Attendees will be empowered with the ability to quickly deploy different service meshes in which they may learn how service meshes function and how each differs from the next, so that they may select the best-fit-for-purpose service mesh for their workloads and their environment.
It will be very helpful for experienced service mesh operators seeking to learn best practices through service mesh design patterns.

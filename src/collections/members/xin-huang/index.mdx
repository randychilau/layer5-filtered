bio: I am a cloud software developer from Intel. I focus on the acceleration on open source softwares for service mesh, such as Istio, Envoy. And I am also a contributor of Service Mesh Performance and the meshery-perf component. I love the open culture of Layer5, where you can find everything about open source and service mesh, and you will love it too.

Project: API Docs for Meshery’s Service Mesh Patterns Playground - Layer5
</h4>
<br />
<h3>About Layer5 and its projects</h3>

<p>The Layer5 community represents the largest collection of service mesh projects and their maintainers in the world. Our inclusive and diverse community stewards projects to provide learning environments, create and implement cloud native industry standards, deployment and operational best practices, benchmarks and abstractions, and more. Our pay-it-forward mentality with every contributor (mentee or not) is a shared commitment by all maintainers (and MeshMates - contributor onboarding buddies) to the open source spirit that pushes Layer5 projects like Meshery forward. New members are always welcome.</p>

### About Meshery
<p>Meshery is the open source, service mesh management plane for enabling the adoption, operation, and management of any service mesh and their workloads. There are many service meshes available. Software-defined networking is difficult to understand. Meshery’s aim is to make the power of the network available to the rest of us.</p>

<h3>About our Community</h3>

Layer5 is all about [its community](https://layer5.io/community) of [contributors](https://layer5.io/community/members). We have designed an onboarding program customized to [meet newcomers](https://layer5.io/community/newcomers) where they’re at and developed an onboarding buddy program, [MeshMates](https://layer5.io/community/meshmates) with individuals dedicated to assisting contributors. Layer5 and Meshery have been around for a year and half and have a healthy, growing community of 300+ contributors. The layer5.io website itself is open source and created by 140+ of our contributors.

Technical writers and other contributors are what comprise Layer5 - an open organization, built for the community by the community. Many student contributors have been placed into new jobs with technology companies like Red Hat, Microsoft, and VMware to name a few of the larger organizations. Layer5 expects much from interns and in return, we put them on stage at DockerCon and KubeCon. We promote them and uplift their works. There are [many](https://www.linkedin.com/company/layer5), [many examples](https://layer5.io/blog/category/community) of this on the layer5.io websites. A number of former interns are now project maintainers.

## LFX Mentorship 2021 Project
<br />

### About the project
<br />
<p><i>Goal: Create the world’s service mesh playground.</i></p>

<p>Meshery’s genesis is that of helping teach people about service mesh technology and enabling to operate this type of cloud native infrastructure confidently. The proposed project is aimed at furthering this mission with interactive API documentation connected to a service mesh learning playground (a running instance of Meshery). This project sits squarely in the crosshairs of our purpose - both for Meshery and Layer5.</p>

### The project’s scope

<p>We will create a new set of interactive documentation for Meshery users to both learn how to use Meshery, but also confidently adopt and operate any service mesh. We have a number of community volunteers lined up and committed to collaboration on the creation of this service mesh playground. The technical writer will collaborate with other engineers, working with Swagger and Docusaurus.</p>

<p>Work that is out-of-scope for this project:</p>

- Creation of the Open API specification for Meshery
- Deployment of Docusarous
- Visual design of the site

<p>We will bring support from the Meshery CI WG, provide a full-time visual and user experience designer and well as three dedicated core maintainers of Meshery. We have one strong technical writing candidate for this project, and estimate that this work will take six months to complete. We will support this technical writer and prioritize any dependencies on the project or community that they may have.</p>

### Measuring project success

<p>To measure success, we will track:</p>

- The number of new API playground users (quantitative - tracked by the system)
- The number of repeat visits of the same users (quantitative - tracked by the system)
- The number of failed attempts to invoke an API (signifies poor documentation) (quantitative - tracked by the system)
- Feedback from users on how intuitive the documentation is (qualitative - tracked through user polls)

<p>We would consider the project successful if, after publication of the new API documentation:</p>

- The total count of performance tests run by Meshery increases by 10% (see the current count on [https://meshery.io](https://meshery.io))
- The new number of new Meshery users increases by 20% (currently at ~1,000 users) 


### Goal: Integration of Open Policy Agent (OPA) and Meshery

- Description: As a golang library integrate OPA into Meshery Server, enabling users to define policies to dictate the manner in which their cloud native infrastructure is to both run and be configured. Design an extensible policy framework in which rules may be augmented and dynamically supplied at runtime. 
- Recommended Skills: golang, rego, reactjs

### Goal: User Interface Overhaul: State Management w/Apollo/GraphQL

- Description: Overcome current architectural issues of:
1) No Caching - In Meshery UI, List of adapters is a state that is being used in multiple components i.e Settings , Dashboard , Connection Wizard and Performance. Refetching the data on every mount of each of these components degrades the user experience. The same goes for all the other data that are being used across multiple components.
2) Multiple Sources of Truth - There is no single source of truth in Meshery UI as all react components manage their own state. Since Meshery UI has to deal with data that frequently changes, like Control Plane Data, Meshsync data etc. it will become hard to keep them in sync if they all manage their own copy of them  in their local state.

- Recommended Skills: reactjs, apollo, graphql, redux

- Upstream Issue (URL): https://github.com/meshery/meshery/issues/5094

- **LFX URL**: https://mentorship.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/project/7592d7db-5517-445b-95e8-14144c49e9b1

### Goal: Adaptive Load Controller

- Description: The adaptive load controller is to execute optimization routines recursivley to determine the maximum load a system can sustain. The maximum load is usually defined by the maximum requests per second (rps) the system can handle. The metrics (CPU usage, latency etc) collected from the system under test are the constraints we provide to judge whether a system under test (SUT) is sustaining the load.

A use-case that fits very well is be the ability to use it to run performance tests on a schedule and track the maximum load a system can handle over time. This could give insights to performance improvements or degradations.

- Recommended Skills: golang, grpc, docker, kubernetes
- Mentor(s): [Lee Calcote](https://github.com/leecalcote), [Xin Huang](https://github.com/gyohuangxin)

### Goal: Convergence of Network and Graph topologies

- Description: Use Neo4j's ability to create graph projections, which copy a subgraph to RAM so that algorithms can be efficiently run. This opens the door to leveraging algorithms in the areas of Centrality, Community Detection, Pathfinding, Topological Link Prediction, etc. Bringing to bear advances made in Machine Learning / AI / recommendation systems, fraud detection could really help to derive meaning and comprehension for future tools. Another example is how ML + graph approaches are used to find and determine the optimal molecular structure of atoms such that desired physical properties are targeted. This approach could be applied to the problem of workload sizing and estimation for service mesh operators and would-be adopters.
- Recommended Skills: cuelang, golang, neo4j

### Goal: Kubernetes ontology and subgraph module design

- Description: Network topologies and graph databases go hand-in-hand. The OpenAPI specifications for Kubernetes provides taxonomy, but augmenting a graph data model with formalized ontologies enables any number of capabilities, one of the more straightforward is the inferencing requisite for natural language processing, and consequently, a human-centric query / response interaction becomes becomes possible. More importantly, more advanced systems can be built when a graph data model of connected systems is upgraded to be a knowledge semantic graph. Deliverables (among other items):

- a Kubernetes ontology using OWL as a popular (and mature) way of doing this.
- a cuelang-based component generator

- Recommended Skills: cuelang, golang, neo4j

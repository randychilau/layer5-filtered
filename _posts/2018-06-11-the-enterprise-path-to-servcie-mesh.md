<h4> Book: <i>The Enterprise Path to Service Mesh Architectures</i></h4>
By Lee Calcote

As a technology leader, you have heard of service mesh architectures in context of microservices. This book will help answer common questions on service mesh architectures, through the lens of a large enterprise. A service mesh approach offers a lot of potential for creating robust and scalable applications, but also introduces new challenges. The book covers how to evaluate your organizationâ€™s readiness, the factors to consider when deciding upon which applications should be built from the ground up or converted with a new service mesh architecture, and offers a path of how you can get there. 

The three most important things readers will learn from this book:

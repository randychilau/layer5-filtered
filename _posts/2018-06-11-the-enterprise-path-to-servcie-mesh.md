<h4> Book: <i>The Enterprise Path to Service Mesh Architectures</i></h4>
By Lee Calcote

As someone interested in modern software design, you have heard of service mesh architectures in context of microservices. This book will help answer common questions on service mesh architectures, through the lens of a large enterprise. Service meshes introduce a new layer into modern infrastructures, offering the potential for creating robust and scalable applications and granular control over them. Is a service mesh right for you? This book covers how to evaluate your organizationâ€™s readiness, the factors to consider when building new applications and converting existing applications to best leverage a service mesh, and offers insight on deployment architectures used to get you there. 

Three most important things readers will learn from this book:

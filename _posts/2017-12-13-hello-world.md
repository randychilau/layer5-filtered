As a technology leader, you have heard of service mesh architectures in context of microservices. This book will help answer common questions on service mesh architectures, through the lens of a large enterprise. A service mesh approach offers a lot of potential for creating robust and scalable applications, but also introduces new challenges. The book covers how to evaluate your organization’s readiness, the factors to consider when deciding upon which applications should be built from the ground up or converted with a new service mesh architecture, and offers a path of how you can get there. 

Three most important things readers will learn from report:

What is a service mesh and why do I need one? 
What are the different service meshes and how do they contrast?
Where services meshes layer in with other technologies.
When and why should I adopt a service mesh?
What are popular deployment models and why?
What are practical steps to adopt a service mesh in my enterprise?
How do I fit a service mesh into my existing infrastructure?
